Mr. Orange:
What happens if the manager won’t give you the diamonds?
Mr. White:
When you’re dealing with a store like this, they’re insured up the ass.
They’re not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever. If you get a
customer, or an employee, who thinks he’s Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in. Everybody jumps. He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose, nobody says fucking shit after that. You
might get some bitch talk shit to you, but give her a look like you’re gonna
smash her in the face next, watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it’s a
manager, that’s a different story. Managers know better than to fuck around,
so if you get one that’s giving you static, he probably thinks he’s a real
cowboy, so you gotta break that son of a bitch in two. If you wanna know
something and he won’t tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one.
Then tell him his thumb’s next. After that he’ll tell you if he wears ladies
underwear. I’m hungry. Let’s get a taco.
